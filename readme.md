#ML model to predict grade from a "random" batch of students

This program creates a random list of students with 
random names. The higher study-habit they have the
higher grade they have. 

The model is then trained on these students. And 
in the end you can input your own student with age
and study habit and predict what his grade will be. 
The higher studyhabit the higer the grade. 

Using a linear regression model.
